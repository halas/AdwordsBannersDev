# AdwordsBannersDev
Gulp configurationa and bootstrap for HTML5 Adwords Banners development

## Installation
clone repository
```
npm install
gulp
```

## Usage
Work in dev directory. You can use es6 in javascript file if you use it separately. 
Better not, if you decide to place it in index.html file for the banner.

run `gulp` first

`gulp serve` starts index.html with iframes of correct size. On change, the iframe itself is reloaded. 

`gulp zip` creates ziped folders

## Remarks about clicktag

Clicktag implementations differ between different adsystems. You don't need clicktag in google Adwords,
you need one in other systems.
